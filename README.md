                     1) I get a list of steps by day for the week, display information about the last day

                     2) Displays information about the last heart rate reading (available in GoogleFit)

FitnessTracker_v.5:  

                     1) In the new activity you can enter your first and last name; when you click on the saved button, the data for the current first and last name will be saved and a new UUID will be generated. 
                     
                     2) Each time you sign in, your last entry is saved, so if you don't want to change your GoogleAccount, you shouldn't make any changes.
